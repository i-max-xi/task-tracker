## Code Organization and Implementation

## Components

- `ui/` contains core UI components like **Task List**, **Task Item**, and **Task Form**.
- `shared/` contains reusable components like **Search Bar** and **Priority Filter**.

## Context API (`task-context.tsx`)

- Manages global state for tasks and search filtering.
- Uses `useReducer` for state updates.
- Saves tasks to `localStorage` to persist them between sessions.

## Testing

- Implemented using **Jest**
- Covers unit tests for core components like **Task List**, **Task Item**, and **Priority Filter**.
